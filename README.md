# Virtual Tourist

## Running the Project
You will need to edit the file Constants.swift replacing the text "PUT_YOUR_FLICKR_API_KEY_HERE" on line 13 with your Flickr API Key.

## Acknowledgements
The following web sites, gists and Udacity projects were used in writing the code for this project.

1. The Swift 2.0 version of the Flickr Finder project from the Udacity iOS Networking course provided quite a bit of the code for the FlickrClient class.
2. The gist at https://gist.github.com/saraswatayu/69d4afdbc506a1c397c6 was very helpful in working out the details of populating the collection view cell.
3. The gist at https://gist.github.com/saraswatayu/0e1067d77ed0cc649d40 was very helpful in working out how to download the images in the background.
4. The blog post [Collection View Default Gestures][http://useyourloaf.com/blog/collection-view-default-gestures.html] explained how to add a gesture recognizer to a collection view. My Swift code is based on the Objective-C code in that post.
